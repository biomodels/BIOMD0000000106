This model is according to the paper _Dynamic Simulation on the Arachidonic
Acid Metabolic Network_ . Figure 2A has been reproduced by SBML ode solver on
line. In the original model, all the reactions are presented as ODE directly.
So curator rewrite each reaction according to the semantics of the paper. In
this paper, the authors used quict complex kinetics law to describe the
catalysis in the network, curators did not necessarily know all the complete
meanings of the paper.
